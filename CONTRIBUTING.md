# Contributing

Welcome to Claude Code Harness for Multi-Agent Team Workflows! This guide covers everything you need to know to contribute effectively, whether you're a human developer, Claude Code, or an AI remote agent.

## 🎯 Quick Start

**For Human Developers**: Follow the complete setup process below
**For AI Agents**: Focus on [AI Agent Guidelines](#ai-agent-guidelines) and [Workflow Process](#workflow-process)

## Prerequisites & Setup

### For Human Developers

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   python3.13 --version    # Python 3.13
   poetry --version        # Poetry (dependency management)
   ```

2. **Clone and Setup**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oib/AITBC.git
   cd AITBC
   poetry install
   # or: python3 -m venv venv && ./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   # Fill in your environment variables
   ```

4. **Per-app setup** (each microservice under `apps/*` has its own `pyproject.toml`):

   ```bash
   cd apps/coordinator-api && poetry install
   ```

### For AI Agents

AI agents (Claude Code, Augment agents) should:

1. **Read this entire document** before starting work
2. **Follow all workflow processes** exactly as human developers
3. **Use the PR template** at `.github/pull_request_template.md`
4. **Run local validation** (`ruff check .`, `mypy aitbc/`, relevant `pytest` suites — see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#development-commands)) before pushing
5. **Reference tracker tickets** in all commits and PRs (no Linear/Jira wired up for this project — GitHub issue/PR numbers serve as the reference, per [`profiles/neutral/`](profiles/neutral/profile.yaml))

## AI Agent Guidelines

### Required Behavior for AI Agents

**✅ MUST DO**:

- Follow the exact branch naming convention: `AITBC-{number}-{description}`
- Use SAFe commit message format with a ticket reference
- Run `ruff check .`, `mypy aitbc/`, and the relevant `pytest` suites before pushing any code
- Use the comprehensive PR template completely
- Follow rebase-first workflow (never create merge commits)
- Reference the ticket/issue in all commits and PR title

**❌ NEVER DO**:

- Skip the CI/CD validation steps
- Create branches without a ticket number
- Use merge commits (always rebase)
- Push without running local validation
- Ignore failing CI checks

### Skills 2.0 and Agent Teams (v2.5.0)

Skills now support fine-grained invocation control via YAML frontmatter fields: `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`, `context: fork`, `allowed-tools`, and `argument-hint`. See the [Skill Authoring Guide](docs/guides/SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md) for details.

Agent Teams is an experimental feature for real-time multi-agent orchestration. See the [Agent Teams Guide](docs/onboarding/AGENT-TEAMS-GUIDE.md).

### AI Agent Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Start work (always from latest main)
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b AITBC-123-implement-feature

# 2. Make changes and commit with SAFe format
git commit -m "feat(scope): implement feature [AITBC-123]"

# 3. Before pushing - ALWAYS validate locally
./venv/bin/python -m ruff check .
./venv/bin/python -m mypy --show-error-codes aitbc/
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit tests/integration -q

# 4. Rebase and push
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease origin AITBC-123-implement-feature

# 5. Create PR using template at .github/pull_request_template.md
```

## Work Product vs. Governor

When you are working **on this repository itself** (developing the boilerplate, not a project
built from it), keep two things mentally separate:

- **Work product — `harness/claude/`.** The shipped Claude Code harness (agent defs, skills,
  commands, hooks, `hooks-config.json`, `settings.template.json`, the harness's own README/SETUP/
  TROUBLESHOOTING docs) lives here as its **editable source**. It is inert — a ticket can edit it
  freely, the same as any other file under version control.
- **Governor — the live `.claude/` + a pinned stable checkout.** The repo's own `.claude/` is what
  Claude Code actually reads to run *this* session, and (under self-hosting) a separate pinned
  **stable** release checkout supplies the agent definitions and scripts that govern work on this
  repo's `dev` branch. Editing `.claude/` directly edits the thing steering your current session —
  don't. **Edit `harness/claude/` only.** The live `.claude/` is now **generated** — it is
  materialized from the release tag recorded in `.governor-tag` (ABS-94, Phase 2b) via
  `scripts/generate-governor.sh`, so it equals `generated(pin)`, NOT a mirror of your edits.
  Mirroring is dead: do not hand-copy changes into `.claude/`. CI rejects direct edits to the
  shipped items under `.claude/` (the drift guard `tests/test-harness-parity.sh` asserts
  `generate-governor.sh --check` passes). Your `harness/claude/` edits reach the live `.claude/`
  and consumers only at **promotion**, when the release commit bumps `.governor-tag` and
  regenerates (ABS-95 wires that step).

This is the same mental model for humans and agents alike: **`harness/claude/` is what you ship;
`.claude/` (plus the stable checkout, when self-hosting) is what governs you while you ship it.**

See [ABS-91 self-hosting model](docs/agent-outputs/ABS-96-layout-decision.md) for the full
namespace rationale, and the [Orchestrator SOP's "Stable-Governs-Dev Mode" section](docs/sop/ORCHESTRATOR_SOP.md#stable-governs-dev-mode-abs-92)
for the two-checkout operating mode.

## Branch Naming Conventions

**REQUIRED FORMAT**: `AITBC-{number}-{short-description}`

### ✅ Correct Examples

- `AITBC-42-add-user-authentication`
- `AITBC-57-fix-profile-image-upload`
- `AITBC-123-implement-stripe-checkout`

### ❌ Incorrect Examples

- `feature/add-dark-mode` (missing ticket number)
- `fix/broken-login-form` (missing ticket number)
- `john-new-feature` (personal naming)
- `WIP` (not descriptive)

### Branch Naming Rules

1. **MUST** start with `AITBC-{number}` (Linear ticket reference)
2. Use lowercase letters and hyphens for description
3. Keep description short but descriptive (max 50 chars total)
4. Never include personal names or dates
5. Make sure the name reflects the actual work being done

**Note**: Branch naming is enforced by reviewer convention. The shipped CI workflows do not validate branch names — add a branch-name check to your pipeline if you want automatic enforcement.

## Commit Message Guidelines

**REQUIRED FORMAT**: SAFe methodology with Linear ticket reference

```
type(scope): description [AITBC-XXX]
```

### Types (Required)

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code formatting (no logic changes)
- `refactor` - Code restructuring (no feature/bug changes)
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks, dependencies
- `ci` - CI/CD pipeline changes

### Scope (Optional)

- `payments` - Payment-related changes
- `auth` - Authentication features
- `ui` - User interface components
- `api` - API routes and backend
- `db` - Database changes

### Examples

✅ **Correct**:

```
feat(payments): add Stripe checkout integration [AITBC-42]
fix(auth): resolve login redirect issue [AITBC-57]
docs: update API documentation [AITBC-123]
```

❌ **Incorrect**:

```
add new feature (missing ticket reference)
feat: add checkout (missing ticket reference)
WIP: working on stuff (not descriptive)
```

**Note**: The CI/CD pipeline will **automatically reject** commits that don't follow this format.

### Exempt commits (operator/release, no ticket)

The ticket tag is **enforced mechanically** on story branches: the PILOT-79 commit-msg
guard (`scripts/hooks/commit-msg-ticket-tag-guard.sh`, installed by the orchestrator into
`<git-common-dir>/hooks/commit-msg`) aborts a **seat** commit on a `<ticket>-auto` story
branch whose message is missing its `[AITBC-XXX]` tag. This is the tag the RTE
Epic-Integration bisect maps a culprit commit to its story with — an untagged commit that
reaches the epic branch can strand the whole epic in `Needs PO Decision`.

Not every commit has a ticket, and a naïve "tag required everywhere" would block releases.
Two commit classes exist; the second is **exempt** and must be *recognisable*, never silently
untagged:

| Class | Tag | Recognised by |
|-------|-----|---------------|
| (a) Seat / story commit | **required** | committed on a `<ticket>-auto` story branch |
| (b) Operator / release commit | not required | subject begins `chore(release):` / `chore(governor):`, **or** the message carries a `[no-ticket]` marker |

Use `[no-ticket]` for a genuinely ticketless commit (a `HARNESS_CHANGELOG` entry, a docs
afterthought) so its exemption is explicit and greppable. Protected branches (`main`/`master`)
and `epic/*` integration branches are operator/RTE territory and are never guarded. Kill
switch (operator only): `ORCH_TICKET_TAG_GUARD=0`.

## Workflow Process

**CRITICAL**: This project uses a **rebase-first workflow** enforced by CI/CD automation.

### 1. Starting Work

```bash
# ALWAYS start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch with ticket number
git checkout -b AITBC-{number}-{description}
```

### 2. During Development

```bash
# Make changes and commit with SAFe format
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): description [AITBC-XXX]"

# Keep branch updated (rebase, never merge)
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

### 3. Before Creating PR

```bash
# REQUIRED: Run local validation
./venv/bin/python -m ruff check .
./venv/bin/python -m mypy --show-error-codes aitbc/
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit tests/integration -q

# Fix any issues before proceeding
```

### 4. Push Changes

```bash
# ALWAYS use force-with-lease after rebase.
# Push to the ACTIVE remote (the pin), never `origin` by convention — see the
# Remote Doctrine below. On a single-remote fork this is just `origin`.
git push --force-with-lease "${ORCH_MAIN_REMOTE:-origin}" AITBC-{number}-{description}
```

> **Remote Doctrine (this repo).** GitLab (`gitlab.haemosan.at`) is the permanent LIVE
> remote; Bitbucket (`origin`) is a **release mirror** that receives only `main` + the
> release tag at release time. Push / MR-open **always follows the active-remote pin
> `ORCH_MAIN_REMOTE`, never `origin` by convention** (mechanically enforced by
> `scripts/active-remote-guard.sh`). The only legitimate Bitbucket write is the release
> mirror push (`scripts/release-mirror-push.sh`). Full doctrine:
> [docs/guides/REMOTE_DOCTRINE_GUIDE.md](docs/guides/REMOTE_DOCTRINE_GUIDE.md).

### 5. Create Pull Request

- **Use the template** at `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- **Fill out ALL sections** completely
- **Reference Linear ticket** in title: `feat(scope): description [AITBC-XXX]`
- **Request appropriate reviewers** (auto-assigned via CODEOWNERS)

### 6. Respond to CI/CD Feedback

The automated pipeline will check:

- ✅ Branch naming format
- ✅ Commit message format
- ✅ Rebase status (no merge commits)
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Code quality (ESLint, TypeScript)
- ✅ Build verification

**If checks fail**: Fix issues and push again (pipeline re-runs automatically)

### 7. Merge Process

- **ONLY use "Rebase and merge"** (maintains linear history)
- **NEVER use "Squash and merge"** or "Create merge commit"
- **Auto-merge available** with `auto-merge` label (if all checks pass)

> **Epic-branch variant (orchestrated v3 epics — [ADR-A-0014](adrs/agentic/ADR-A-0014-workflow-v3-per-epic-merge-gate.md)).**
> When a story belongs to an orchestrated Workflow v3 epic, its branch PRs into the epic's
> integration branch `epic/AITBC-XX-{description}` **instead of** `main` —
> same rebase-first, same "Rebase and merge", same commit format. The epic branch is kept current
> via a sanctioned rebase onto `origin/main` and reaches `main` through **one
> human-merged PR** after the whole epic is tested on staging. Agents never merge to
> `main`. Epic-less stories (e.g. standalone follow-ups) keep the standard flow above:
> a per-story PR into `main`, merged by a human.

## Agent Exit States (vNext Contract)

Each agent role has explicit exit states that define handoff points in the workflow:

```
┌─────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Role            │ Exit State                                │
├─────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ BE-Developer    │ "Ready for QAS"                           │
│ FE-Developer    │ "Ready for QAS"                           │
│ Data-Engineer   │ "Ready for QAS"                           │
│ QAS             │ "Approved for RTE"                        │
│ RTE             │ "Ready for HITL Review"                   │
│ System Architect│ "Stage 1 Approved - Ready for ARCHitect"  │
│ HITL            │ MERGED                                    │
└─────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Gate Quick Reference

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│ Gate            │ Owner           │ Blocking?               │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ Stop-the-Line   │ Implementer     │ YES - no AC = no work   │
│ QAS Gate        │ QAS             │ YES - no approval = stop│
│ Stage 1 Review  │ System Architect│ YES - pattern check     │
│ Stage 2 Review  │ ARCHitect-CLI   │ YES - architecture check│
│ HITL Merge      │ oib            │ YES - final authority   │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

### Role Collapsing (AITBC-499)

- **RTE**: Collapsible (PR creation can be done by implementer)
- **QAS**: NOT collapsible (independence gate - spawn subagent)
- **SecEng**: NOT collapsible (security audit requires independence)

See [Agent Workflow SOP v1.4](./docs/sop/AGENT_WORKFLOW_SOP.md) for complete details.

## Pull Request Process

### PR Template Requirements

**MUST USE**: `.github/pull_request_template.md` (comprehensive template)

**Required Sections**:

- 📋 Summary with Linear ticket link
- 🎯 Changes Made (detailed list)
- 🧪 Testing (coverage and results)
- 📊 Impact Analysis (files changed, breaking changes)
- 🔄 Multi-Team Coordination (rebase status, dependencies)
- ✅ Pre-merge Checklist (quality, security, SAFe compliance)

### Automated PR Validation

The CI/CD pipeline automatically validates:

1. **Structure Validation** 🔍
   - Branch naming: `AITBC-{number}-{description}`
   - PR title includes Linear ticket: `[AITBC-XXX]`
   - Linear ticket exists and is valid

2. **Rebase Status Check** 🔄
   - Branch is up-to-date with `main`
   - No merge commits (linear history maintained)
   - Auto-comments with rebase instructions if needed

3. **Comprehensive Testing** 🧪
   - Unit tests (fast feedback)
   - Integration tests (API/database)
   - E2E tests (full user workflows)

4. **Quality & Security** 🔍
   - ESLint + TypeScript validation
   - Security audit and secret detection
   - Code formatting (Prettier)

5. **Build Verification** 🏗️
   - Next.js production build
   - Asset optimization
   - Build artifact validation

6. **Conflict Detection** 🚨
   - High-risk file monitoring (`.env.template`, `config.ts`, `package.json`)
   - Team notification triggers
   - Extra review requirements for sensitive changes

### Review Process

**Automatic Assignment**: Based on CODEOWNERS file

- Core config files → oib (ARCHitect-in-the-IDE)
- Payment features → @payments-team oib
- Authentication → @auth-team oib
- Database schema → @backend-team oib

**Review Requirements**:

- At least 1 required reviewer approval
- All CI checks must pass
- No merge conflicts
- Linear history maintained

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Secrets Configuration

**Required for full CI test coverage** (optional but recommended):

1. Navigate to your repository's **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
2. Add the following repository secrets:
   - `STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe test mode secret key (sk*test*...)
   - `STRIPE_TEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Your Stripe test webhook signing secret (whsec\_...)

**Note**: CI will run with safe placeholders if these aren't configured, but real test keys provide better coverage.

### Local Validation Commands

```bash
# Run all quality checks (REQUIRED before pushing)
yarn ci:validate

# Individual checks
yarn type-check      # TypeScript validation
yarn lint           # ESLint validation (uses eslint.config.mjs flat config - AITBC-290)
yarn test:unit      # Unit tests
yarn test:integration # Integration tests
yarn format:check   # Prettier formatting
yarn build          # Production build test
```

**Note (AITBC-290)**: Linting now uses ESLint CLI directly instead of `next lint`. Configuration is in `eslint.config.mjs` (flat config format). The legacy `.eslintrc.json` has been removed.

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Structure Validation** → Validates branch/PR format
2. **Rebase Status Check** → Ensures linear history
3. **Comprehensive Testing** → All test suites
4. **Quality & Security** → Code quality and security
5. **Build Verification** → Production build test
6. **Conflict Detection** → High-risk file monitoring

### Pipeline Benefits

- **No merge conflicts** between teams (rebase enforcement)
- **Automatic quality gates** (no broken code reaches `main`)
- **Team coordination** (automatic notifications and assignments)
- **Parallel development** (teams work simultaneously safely)

## Local Development

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Database (PostgreSQL via Docker)
docker-compose up -d

# Environment variables
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your values

# Database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate

# RLS Security Setup (Important!)
# The database now uses Row Level Security for data protection
# Use aitbc_app_user for proper RLS enforcement in development
# See docs/database/RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md for details
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
yarn dev

# Database management
npx prisma studio          # Database GUI
npx prisma migrate dev      # Run migrations
npx prisma db push         # Push schema changes (dev only)

# Testing
yarn test:unit             # Unit tests
yarn test:integration      # Integration tests
yarn test:e2e             # E2E tests (requires running server)

# Code quality
yarn lint                  # ESLint (migrated from 'next lint' - AITBC-290)
yarn lint:fix             # Auto-fix ESLint issues
yarn format               # Format with Prettier
yarn type-check           # TypeScript validation

# RLS Security Testing
node scripts/test-rls-phase3-simple.js  # Basic RLS functionality test
# Run comprehensive security validation:
# cat scripts/rls-phase4-final-validation.sql | docker exec -i aitbc-postgres-1 psql -U aitbc_app_user -d aitbc
```

## Row Level Security (RLS) Development

### 🔒 Security Implementation

The AITBC application uses **Row Level Security (RLS)** for database-level data protection. This is critical for preventing cross-user data access.

### RLS Development Guidelines

**🚨 CURRENT STATUS:**

- RLS lint is warn-only temporarily; migrate to withRLS()
- DB migrations are manual-only with ARCHitect approval

**✅ MUST DO when working with database operations:**

- Use `withUserContext()`, `withAdminContext()`, or `withSystemContext()` helpers
- Test with `aitbc_app_user` role (not `aitbc` superuser)
- Validate user data isolation in your tests
- Check RLS context is properly set before database queries

**❌ NEVER DO:**

- Bypass RLS context setting for user operations
- Use `aitbc` (superuser) for application testing
- Trust session variables for role validation
- Assume users can access data without proper context

### RLS Testing Requirements

```bash
# Test basic RLS functionality
node scripts/test-rls-phase3-simple.js

# Run comprehensive security validation
cat scripts/rls-phase4-final-validation.sql | docker exec -i aitbc-postgres-1 psql -U aitbc_app_user -d aitbc

# Test user isolation manually
docker exec aitbc-postgres-1 psql -U aitbc_app_user -d aitbc -c "
  SET app.current_user_id = 'your_test_user';
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user; -- Should see only your test user's data
"
```

### Common RLS Patterns

```typescript
// User operation - automatic context setting
const userPayments = await withUserContext(prisma, userId, async (client) => {
  return client.payments.findMany({ where: { user_id: userId } });
});

// Admin operation - requires admin role
const webhookEvents = await withAdminContext(prisma, userId, async (client) => {
  return client.webhook_events.findMany();
});

// System operation - for background tasks
const systemData = await withSystemContext(
  prisma,
  "webhook",
  async (client) => {
    return client.webhook_events.create({ data: webhookData });
  },
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common CI/CD Issues

**Branch Name Rejected**:

```bash
# Rename branch to correct format
git branch -m AITBC-{number}-{description}
git push origin -u AITBC-{number}-{description}
git push origin --delete old-branch-name
```

**Rebase Required**:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/dev
# Resolve any conflicts
git push --force-with-lease origin your-branch
```

**Commit Message Format Error**:

```bash
# Amend last commit message
git commit --amend -m "feat(scope): description [AITBC-XXX]"
git push --force-with-lease origin your-branch
```

**CI Validation Failures**:

```bash
# Run local validation to see specific issues
yarn ci:validate

# Fix issues and commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve CI validation issues [AITBC-XXX]"
```
