# Skipped Integration Tests - Roadmap Status

## Overview
Several integration tests are skipped because the features are not yet fully implemented. Here's the status of each:

## 1. Wallet Integration Tests
**Test**: `test_job_payment_flow` in `TestWalletToCoordinatorIntegration`
**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
- **Roadmap Reference**: Stage 11 - Trade Exchange & Token Economy [COMPLETED: 2025-12-28]
- **Completed**: 
  - ✅ Bitcoin payment gateway for AITBC token purchases
  - ✅ Payment request API with unique payment addresses
  - ✅ QR code generation for mobile payments
  - ✅ Exchange payment endpoints (/api/exchange/*)
- **Missing**: Full integration between wallet daemon and coordinator for job payments

## 2. Marketplace Integration Tests
**Test**: `test_service_listing_and_booking` in `TestMarketplaceIntegration`
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Roadmap Reference**: Stage 3 - Pool Hub & Marketplace [COMPLETED: 2025-12-22]
- **Completed**:
  - ✅ Marketplace web scaffolding
  - ✅ Auth/session scaffolding
  - ✅ Production deployment at https://aitbc.bubuit.net/marketplace/
- **Note**: Test infrastructure needs updating to connect to live marketplace

## 3. Security Integration Tests
**Test**: `test_end_to_end_encryption` in `TestSecurityIntegration`
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Roadmap Reference**: Stage 12 - Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation [COMPLETED: 2025-12-28]
- **Completed**:
  - ✅ ZK proof service integration with coordinator API
  - ✅ ZK proof generation in coordinator service
  - ✅ Confidential transaction support
- **Note**: Test infrastructure needs updating to use actual security features

## 4. Performance Integration Tests
**Tests**: 
- `test_high_throughput_job_processing` in `TestPerformanceIntegration`
- `test_scalability_under_load` in `TestPerformanceIntegration`
**Status**: 🔄 **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
- **Roadmap Reference**: Multiple stages
- **Completed**:
  - ✅ Performance metrics collection (Stage 4)
  - ✅ Autoscaling policies (Stage 5)
  - ✅ Load testing infrastructure
- **Missing**: Dedicated performance test suite with specific thresholds

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update Marketplace Test**: Connect test to the live marketplace endpoint
2. **Update Security Test**: Use actual ZK proof features instead of mocks
3. **Implement Performance Tests**: Create proper performance test suite with defined thresholds

### For Wallet Integration
The wallet daemon exists but the coordinator integration for job payments needs to be implemented. This would involve:
- Adding payment endpoints to coordinator API
- Integrating wallet daemon for payment processing
- Adding escrow functionality for job payments

### Test Infrastructure Improvements
- Set up test environment with access to live services
- Create test data fixtures for marketplace and security tests
- Implement performance benchmarks with specific thresholds

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize wallet-coordinator integration (critical for job payment flow)
2. Update existing tests to use implemented features
3. Add comprehensive performance test suite
4. Consider adding end-to-end tests that span multiple services
