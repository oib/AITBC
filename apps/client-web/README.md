# Client Web

## Purpose & Scope

Front-end application that allows users to submit compute jobs, monitor status, and interact with AITBC services. See `docs/bootstrap/dirs.md` and `docs/bootstrap/examples.md` for guidance.

## Development Setup

Implementation pending. Recommended stack: lightweight web framework (per bootstrap doc) without heavy front-end frameworks.
