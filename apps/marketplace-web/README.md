# Marketplace Web

## Purpose & Scope

Vite-powered vanilla TypeScript app for listing compute offers, placing bids, and showing market analytics. Follow the implementation blueprint in `docs/bootstrap/marketplace_web.md`.

## Development Setup

- Install dependencies with `npm install` once `package.json` is defined.
- Run the dev server via `npm run dev`.
- Build for production with `npm run build` and preview using `npm run preview`.

## Notes

Works against mock API responses initially; switch to real coordinator/pool-hub endpoints later via `VITE_API_BASE`.
