@dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access\n control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```solidity\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n function call, use {hasRole}:\n ```solidity\n function foo() public {\n     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules}\n to enforce additional security measures for this

module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ```solidity bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules} to enforce additional security measures for this role.\",\"errors\":{\"AccessControlBadConfirmation()\":[{\"details\":\"The caller of a function is not the expected one.
