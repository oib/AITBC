# MyPy pre-commit hook for clean apps
#
# This hook checked nothing at all until 2026-08-11. It passed `apps/ffmpeg` and
# `apps/whisper` to mypy; the only Python file in either is `main.py`, and
# pyproject.toml excludes `^apps/[^/]+/main\.py$`. mypy treats "directory with no
# checkable files" as a hard error and aborts *before* checking any of the other
# twelve. The abort message contains no "error:" substring, the grep below found
# nothing, and the hook printed "✅ MyPy: All clean apps pass" on every commit.
# Removing those two directories from the list surfaced 29 real errors in 11 files.
#
# Two changes keep it honest:
#   1. Only directories that actually have checkable files are passed.
#   2. mypy's exit code is checked, so a future abort fails the hook instead of
#      being read as success. The grep alone could not tell the difference between
#      "no errors" and "never ran".
#
# The 29 pre-existing errors were recorded in mypy-baseline.txt; the hook fails on
# errors not in that file. Same ratchet as scripts/lint/no_float_money.py: the
# backlog does not block commits, a new error does. Shrink it with --update.
#
# V23-46: the baseline is now empty, so this is a plain gate again. It started at 29
# and five of those were runtime TypeErrors -- calls to PaymentService.create_payment
# and release_payment missing a required argument, on paths that could therefore never
# have completed. Two annotations accounted for most of the rest: pool-hub's services
# declared `db: Session` while every call site passes an AsyncSession (23 `type: ignore`
# comments existed to cover for that one word), and apps/edge's two clients had an
# unannotated `__aenter__`, so `async with Client() as c` bound c as Any and every
# result off it was Any too.
#
# Keep it empty. A baseline that grows back is a baseline nobody reads.
#
# 2026-08-23: cli/ was never in APPS, so 154 source files went unchecked. Its
# errors still leaked into the output whenever an app's import graph happened to
# reach them, which made the gate non-deterministic: hub reported one cli error on
# a warm cache and three on a cold one, aitbc3 reported none at all. Adding cli to
# APPS makes the coverage explicit and the result reproducible.
#
# The errors that surfaced are recorded here rather than fixed, so the ratchet is
# non-empty again. This is a debt, not a decision to live with: the paragraph above
# still applies. Shrink it with --update as the entries are fixed.
#
# Generate the baseline on a host with the full dependency set. Where torch,
# tenseal or opentelemetry are missing, mypy degrades those imports to Any and the
# 'type: ignore' comments covering them are reported as unused -- roughly 17 bogus
# errors that would otherwise be baselined as real.
#
# aitbc/ was the same defect one layer down, and adding cli did not fix it. The
# top-level package was not in APPS either, so whether it got checked depended on
# whether it happened to be pip-installed on the host: aitbc3 has aitbc==0.10.18
# with an aitbc.pth, so mypy resolved it in site-packages, called it third-party
# and --ignore-missing-imports silenced it. hub has aitbc-cli and aitbc-shared but
# no bare aitbc, so mypy resolved it from the working tree and checked it as
# first-party. Same commit, same mypy 2.1.0, same ecdsa 0.19.2 -- two errors on one
# host and none on the other. Naming the directory here settles it: an explicit
# path is checked as first-party regardless of what pip has installed.
